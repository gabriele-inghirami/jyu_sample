  ! -eta_pseudorap_max to +eta_pseudorap_max
  ! if D2=.false. then we perform a 3D sampling and the pseudorapidity is simply that of the freeze-out hypersurface cell
  logical, parameter :: D2=.false.

  ! maximum absolute value of the pseudorapidity added to the sampled particle momentum
  real(8), parameter :: eta_pseudorap_max=2.d0

  ! tecnical expert options

  ! the minimum value of the Cooper-Frye maximum probability to sample a particle
  ! very small values allow to try to sample a particle even if it is very unlikely that it will be created,
  ! however, if too small, the marginal improved accuracy comes at the expense of overall longer sampling times
  real(8), parameter :: minCF=1.e-12

  ! maximum value of the momentum to be used in the integral of the distrbution function for the sampling
  ! the higher this value, the longer the integration time; however, if it is too small, it might introduce biases
  ! when sampling the momentum of heavy hadrons
  real(8), parameter :: PMAX_BOX=12

  ! below this particle rest mass value [GeV] we use a high order expansion
  ! with Bessel functions to compute the particle density
  real(8), parameter :: MASS_LIMIT_FOR_HIGHER_EXPANSION=0.6

  ! the number of terms in the high order expansion with Bessel functions 
  integer, parameter :: CUT_PI=10

  ! the resolution of the coarse grained grid to get a quick,
  ! but raw estimate the maximum of the distribution to sample a particle
  ! N_dp = num. of cells of momentum
  ! N_dphi = num. of cells of the azimuthal angle phi (0 - 2\pi)
  ! N_dth = num. of cells of the polar angle theta (0 - \pi)
  integer, parameter :: N_dp=121, N_dphi=81, N_dth=41

  ! parameter to increase the estimated value of the maximum of the sampling distribution found with the coarse method
  real(8), parameter :: MAXfactor=1.2
