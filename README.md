## WARNING: repository incomplete ##

**I am currently assembling the repository from an already existing code, but the work is in progess and many essential files are still missing**

This programs samples hadrons from a freeze-out hypersurface.
To get more information about how it works and how to use it, please, enter in the documentation subdirectory and execute:
`pdflatex manual.tex`
At the end of the compilation process, you will get a "manual.pdf" document with the instructions.
